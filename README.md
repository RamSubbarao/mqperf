### MQ Performance documents

This github repository will be used to publish MQ Performance documents from the MQ Performance Team based in Hursley, England.

For many years the traditional place for distributed Performance reports has been the [IBM SupportPac](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27007150) website. 

For new documents and performance articles, we intend to use this repository as the home for MQ Performance collateral.

### MQ Appliance

The M2001 MQ Appliance was released in June 2016, and the accompanying MQ Appliance Performance Report (MPA1) has been updated to show the increased performance on the new Hardware. [MPA1-2.0.pdf](./MPA1-2.0.pdf)

The MQ Appliance HA and DR Performance Report (MPA2) will be updated shortly and will be made available here in due course, meanwhile the MPA2 report for M2000 is available for download. [MPA2.pdf](./MPA2.pdf)

### MQ Distributed

We intend to publish future versions of the MQ base performance documents.
