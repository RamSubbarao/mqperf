### MQ Performance documents

This github repository will be used to publish MQ Performance documents from the MQ Performance Team based in Hursley, England.

For many years the traditional place for distributed Performance reports has been the [IBM SupportPac](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27007150) website. 

For new documents and performance articles, we intend to use this repository as the home for MQ Performance collateral.

The M2001 MQ Appliance was released in June 2016, and the accompanying MQ Appliance Performance Report (MPA1) MQ Appliance HA and DR Performance Report (MPA2) have been updated to show the increased performance on the new Hardware:
