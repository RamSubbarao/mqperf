  "body": "### MQ Performance documents\r\n\r\nThis github repository will be used to publish MQ Performance documents from the MQ Performance Team based in Hursley, England.\r\n\r\nFor many years the traditional place for distributed Performance reports has been the [IBM SupportPac](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27007150) website. \r\n\r\nFor new documents and performance articles, we intend to use this repository as the home for MQ Performance collateral.\r\n\r\n### MQ Appliance\r\n#### M2001\r\n\r\nThe M2001 MQ Appliance was released in June 2016, and the accompanying MQ Appliance Performance Report (MPA1) MQ Appliance HA and DR Performance Report (MPA2) have been updated to show the increased performance on the new Hardware:\r\n- M2001 Performance Report [MPA1-2.0.pdf](./MPA1-2.0.pdf)\r\n- M2001 HA and DR Performance Report [MPA2-2.0.pdf](./MPA2-2.0.pdf)\r\n\r\n#### M2000\r\n\r\nThe M2000 MQ Appliance was the original version of the MQ Appliance and the performance reports that relate to this model are available here:\r\n- M2000 Performance Report [MPA1.pdf](./MPA1.pdf) \r\n- M2000 HA and DR Performance Report [MPA2.pdf](./MPA2.pdf) \r\n\r\n### MQ Distributed\r\n\r\nWe intend to publish future versions of the MQ base performance documents.\r\n\r\n#### AMS\r\n\r\nMQ V9 delivered a new AMS Quality of Protection called ‘Confidentiality’. A performance whitepaper has been produced that illustrates the performance profile this new mode brings by comparing it to existing AMS and non AMS scenarios. [AMS.pdf](./AMS.pdf)\r\n\r\n### MQ for z/OS\r\n\r\nPerformance reports for the latest version of IBM MQ for z/OS will initially be published both here and on the [IBM SupportPac](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27007150) website. \r\n- MQ for z/OS Capacity Planning and Tuning guide [MP16.pdf](./mp16.pdf). This report provides capacity planning and setup/tuning information for IBM MQ for z/OS version 9.0 and earlier releases. It describes how to define performance critical queue manager and channel initiator environment parameters. This version of the report includes LOGLOAD considerations, queue manager restart, CFCC level 21 and the updated IMS Preload module list.\r\n- MQ for z/OS version 9.0 performance report [MP1K.pdf](./mp1k.pdf). The report discusses the performance of AMS, including the new AMS 'Confidentiality' Quality of Protection, using IBM MQ classes for JMS in both CICS OSGi JVM Server and IMS environments as well as page set statistics.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Get in touch\r\nYou can contact @stmassey and @pharrishur with questions about the MQ Performance content.\r\n\r\n",
