description=FIO Write test to simulate MQ logging activity using blocksize of xK

; Device to write to; Note all data on that partition/disk will be destroyed
directory=/disk/
;filename=fio-file

; Use non-buffered I/O (O_DIRECT)
direct=1

; Number of IOs to perform before issuing fsync
;fsync=1

; Could enable fdatasync=1 to only sync the data parts of the file (replicate MQ)
; Initial tests used fsync so leaving for now
 fdatasync=1

; Use synchronous I/O (O_SYNC)
sync=1

; Lock files before writing
lockfile=exclusive

overwrite=1

; sync means use read/write
; psync means use pread/pwrite
; vsync readv/writev
; libaio use asynchronous I/o
; posixaio
; mmap
; syslet-rw
; sg
; null
ioengine=sync

; I/O pattern
;  read sequential reads
;  write sequence writes
;  randread random reads
;  randwrite random writes
;  rw mixed sequential reads and writes
;  randrw mixes random reads and writes
rw=write

; Test is time based on runtime seconds
time_based=1

; Runtime in seconds
runtime=180

; Number of threads
numjobs=1

; Number of I/O units to keep in flight against the file; doesnt apply to sync io engines
iodepth=1

; Report total instead of per-job
group_reporting

; Number of files; Only half seem to be used for writing
nrfiles=20 

; Number of simultaneousuly open files
openfiles=1

; File size
filesize=256MB

; Fill device until 'No space left on device' is encountered. This will not occur on raw devices
fill_device=1

; Run verify phase after write phase. Only valid if verify option provided
do_verify=0
